# aws-inventory
This tool is designed to generate a (possibly) complete list (in JSON format) of assets within AWS account.
This is a fork of [aws-inventory](https://github.com/janiko71/aws-inventory/).
This repo exists as its own entity as I have particular goals to reach with this tool that might not be in line with anyone else's (e.g. products that don't cost money, or cost ridiculous amount of money, so private user won't care about those).
I also have an alergy for hashtags :) so a different formatting style all over.

# progress so far.
* IAM (users, groups)
* kinesis
* athena (streams and databases)
* apigatewayv2
* shield (list protected assets)
* codepipeline
* codebuild
* (code)deploy

# TODO:
* merge IAM users and groups into one (break-down one way or the other)
