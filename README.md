# aws-inventory
This tool is designed to generate a (possibly) complete list (in JSON format) of assets within AWS account.
This is a fork of [aws-inventory](https://github.com/janiko71/aws-inventory/).
This repo exists as its own entity as I have particular goals to reach with this tool that might not be in line with anyone else's.
I also have an alergy for hashtags :) so a different formatting style all over.

# progress so far.
* IAM (users, groups)
* kinesis
* athena (streams and databases)
* apigatewayv2


# TODO:
* merge IAM users and groups into one (break-down one way or the other)
* codepipeline, codedeploy, codebuild
